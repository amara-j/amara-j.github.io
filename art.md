## [Crumbs!](https://vimeo.com/552521675)

I wrote, recorded, and arranged an original soundtrack for an animated short with my dad, Luke Jaeger aka [Trickfilm](https://trickfilm.github.io/index.html). Did you ever wonder what happens to your bread in the toaster?

## [Alagator](https://alagator.bandcamp.com)

I play guitar for a Finnish-language slowcore band! We're getting back together after a long COVID pause and will record an album in 2021.

## [Miniluv](https://soundcloud.com/miniluvmusic)

Solo projects that I've written/recorded/produced.
