Here are some websites I've built recently. Click on a project title to see it in action.

## [Twitter Insurrection](https://amara-j.github.io/twitter-insurrection/))

An interactive hour-by-hour exploration of the Twitter landscape on the day of the riots at the U.S. Capitol. For each hour, shows the network structure of the top five accounts (nodes are accounts, edges are mentions or retweets) and displays randomized tweets from that timeframe. Also displays the top five words for each hour, extracted using text analysis on tweet bodies. Can you see any changes in the network structure throughout the day as violence escalates? Thanks to the MIT Media Lab's Center for Constructive Communication for the dataset.

<!-- ## [I Am The Controller](https://github.com/amara-j/I-am-the-controller#readme)

Motion detecting instrument controlled with your computer camera, co-created at the Recurse Center! View our artists' statement [here](https://github.com/amara-j/I-am-the-controller). Large movements as well as blinks or changing facial expressions should all trigger audio in your browser. Note: if this app is not working for you, check that camera permissions are enabled with the right camera input selected, and that your browser is not set up to block video requests. -->

## [BangBangCon](https://youtu.be/VlJwzxrrvRk?t=2835)

I did a talk on musical authentication at [!!Con 2021](https://bangbangcon.com/)– a tech conference with a mission to "celebrate the joyous, exciting, and surprising moments in computing"! You can also check out my [talk's abstract](https://bangbangcon.com/speakers.html#amara-jaeger) and the [demo website I built](https://amara-j.github.io/bangbangcon//).

## [Color Palette Picker](https://amara-j.github.io/colorpicker/)

Press the space bar to randomly generate a new palette of five colors. Hover over any color swatch to view its Hex color code, and click anywhere on a swatch to copy its code to your clipboard. If you find a color you love, click the heart icon below its swatch to pin it on your screen– pinned swatches won't change when you press the spacebar. Keep pressing and pinning until you find a color scheme you love. Happy scheming!

## [Secure Password Generator](https://amara-j.github.io/password-generator/)

Press the space bar to generate a new random password. Press enter to copy. Use the slider to change the length of the passwords generated. Select whether to include or exclude symbols and numbers.

## [Calculator Utility](https://amara-j.github.io/calculator/)

Click the buttons on the screen or use your keyboard to enter expressions for all your calculator needs!

## [Timer Utility](https://amara-j.github.io/timer/)

Click to adjust or type in a time interval up to 24 hours.
